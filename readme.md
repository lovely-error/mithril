Here I explore
1. `4ops-wide VLIW`
2. `explicit caching`

So far computing 10 iterations of fib seqv in scratchpad mem shows this perf props

`Executed 260 instructions (117 nops) in 65 cycles (0 on gmem access)`

Not very promissing so far
1. Loops have to not be sparse.
   1. 55% wasted EUs in fib code
   2. Need 4x EUs (or more!)
      1. Semisolvable with unified ALUs?
2. OOE is limited
   1. Wont run many loops simultaneously
3. Width tied to impl can possibly cause binary-level portability issues
4. Need faf scartchpad mem or busted

Conclusion: join the dark side, embrace register renaming in chip ðŸ’€ and stuff (?)

Maybe lifting the restriction about in-block intruction dependencies would make it more viable? Sorta turn it into some blend of vliw and dataflow design... (or do it as an implementation detail for some existing ISA...)
